  Type:

  Formula:
    $ref: PartitionFormula.yaml
  Name:
    type: string
    example: My Partition
    description: >-
      Name is an optional name for the partition, only usable with GPT partition table types.
  MountPoint:
    type: string
    example: "/"
    description: >-
      Where to mount the partition, it must be set for partitions that are filesystem types.
  PartitionID:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    example: 1
    description: >-
      A partitionID may be explicitly set for the partition and this allows for out-of-order partitions in the table (like VMWare). 
      If zero, sequential partitions are created starting at 1. Gaps in the partition ID numbering is also allowable (VMWare).
  Bootable:
    type: boolean
    example: false
    description: >-
      Identify a bootable partition.
  MakeOptions:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: Provide options for the partition's creation.
  MountOptions:
    type: string
    example: errors=remount-ro
    description: >-
      Provide options for the patition mount. If empty, "defaults" will be used for filesystem partition types.
      MountOptions will be placed in the "options" field for the partition in /etc/fstab.
