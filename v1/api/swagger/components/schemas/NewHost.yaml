  Name:
    type: string
    example: NewHostName
    description: >-
      The host name used when installing the host operating system.  Note that
      some OS implementations may require the name to be formatted as a fully
      qualified domain name.
  Description:
    type: string
    example: Description of new Host
  ServiceID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The image service identifier must be identifer of one of the available
      imaging services provided by the AvailableImage array returned as part of
      the get /available-resources call. Images are typically described by
      category (e.g. Linux), flavor (e.g. ubuntu) and version (e.g.
      18.04-20190807)
  LocationID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The location ID must be one of those provided by the LocationInfo array
      returned as part of the get /available-resources call.  The locations are
      typically described by country, region, and data center.

      The location ID must also be one that has sufficient inventory for the
      selected MachineSize.  See the MachineInventory array as returned by the
      get /available-resources call to select a location that has machines
      available with the correct machine size.
  MachineSizeID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The machine size ID must be one of those listed in the MachineSizes array
      returned as part of the get /available-resources call.  This array
      provides the name and detailed description for each machine size.  Use the
      MachineInventory array provided by the get /available-resources call to
      find a location with an adequate inventory of machines with the desired
      machine size.
  MachineID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: The machine ID is normally not used.
  SSHKeyIDs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      These IDs must correspond to the IDs for SSH keys already created within
      the context of the project.  These SSH keys and those included as
      SSHAuthorizedKeys will be used together to provision SSH keys when the
      machine is imaged.
    items:
      type: string
      format: uuid
  NetworkIDs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      The list of IDs corresponding to the networks that will be provisioned to
      the host. These networks must be among those listed in the Networks array
      returned by the get /available-resources call.  This list must include the
      ID for any network identified by the HostUseEnum as Required.
    items:
      type: string
      format: uuid
  PreAllocatedIPs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A list of pre-allocated IP addresses to be used for corresponding
      networks. This array of IP addresses, if present, is in one-to-one
      correspondence with Networks.
    items:
      type: string
    example:
      - 10.0.0.4
      - 10.0.0.8
  NetworkForDefaultRoute:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: The host default network ID
  VolumeIDs:
    description: >-
      The list of IDs corresponding to existing, unattached volumes that should
      be attached to the new host.  The volume must be one of those listed in
      the Volumes array returned by the get /available-resources call.  In
      addition, the volume must be in the visible state and not a part of any
      current VolumeAttachment (see get volume-attachments)
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      format: uuid
  NewVolumes:
    type: array
    description: >-
      New volumes may be created and connected to the Host when the host is
      provisioned. The information provided here to create a host is the same as
      required when doing a post /volumes call
    items:
      $ref: ./AddVolume.yaml
  UserData:
    type: string
    description: User-provided data to be attached to the image configuration data.
  NodeID:
    type: string
    example: Node21
    description: >-
      User-provided data to represent the identity of the host within an
      application environment. For example, this could be set to represent the
      Kubernetes node ID if the host is provisioned as a Kubernetes node.
