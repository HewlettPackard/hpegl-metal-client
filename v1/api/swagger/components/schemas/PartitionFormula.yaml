  - MinSize
  - MaxSize
properties:
  Equation:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Represents a partition size in MiB. 
      As a special case a size of 0 can be specified that will equate to the remaining space on the disk.
    example: 500M
  MinSize:
    type: string
    description: >-
      It causes the value computed by formula execution to be rounded up to MinSize; if MinSize is non-zero.
      Multipliers like M and G maybe used, e.g. 1M == (1024*1024)bytes. An empty string means zero bytes. 
      If no multiplier is specified M is assumed.
    example: 1M
  MaxSize:
    type: string
    description: >-
      MaxSize causes the value computed by formula execution to be rounded up to MaxSize; if MaxSize is non-zero.
      Multipliers like M, G and T maybe used, e.g. 1M == (1024*1024)bytes. An empty string means zero bytes. 
      If no multiplier is specified M is assumed. Equations may also be used e.g. 25%disk means MaxSize will cause any partition 
      to never exceed 25% of device capacity.
