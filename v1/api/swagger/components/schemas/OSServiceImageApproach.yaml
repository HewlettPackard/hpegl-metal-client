  Indicates how the service image is installed. 
  The "Service Client" approach installs the OS image by booting a GLM service OS, 
  that then runs the GLM Service Client to deploy and setup a TGZ root file system image. 
  The "Virtual Media" approach uses an OS .ISO installer image and OS automation files 
  (e.g. kickstart and cloud-init files) mounted over iLO virtual media.
