  description: >
    Used to get lists of options that are used when creating hosts and volumes.
    A get /available-resources will return an object that includes the following
    arrays:

    * Images - A list of image service IDs along with their category (Linux), 
      flavor (ubuntu), and version (18.04)

    * MachineSizes - A list of machine size IDs along with the machine size 
      names and detailed descriptions

    * Locations - A list of location IDs along with their country, region, 
      and data center.

    * Networks - A list of available Network IDs along with the network name,
      location ID, network kind, and host usage (Required, Default, Optional)

    * MachineInventory - Information about the available inventory of machines 
      based on location ID and machine size ID.  While this information may 
      change rapidly, it can be used by GUIs and systems to restrict host
      creates to locations with the desired machine size.

    * StorageInventory - Information about the current available storage
    capacity 
      for a specific volume flavor by site. 

    * VolumeFlavors - A list of volume flavor IDs along with their name and 
      detailed description.

    * Volumes - A list of current, existing volumes.  If the volume is in the
      the right state, it could be attached to a new Host.
