  summary: Get servers allocation
  description: | 
    Returns an array of allocation information for each server instance type. Each instance type's allocation information is further grouped by service type.
    When using a Metal token, the value in the 'Membership' header determines the scope of the response, i.e., Project or Hoster. However, the default scope is Tenant/Hoster when using the GL IAM token. 
    If the allocation data is needed for a specific project, then the 'Project' header must be present in the request.
    If the 'siteID' query parameter is present, the information returned is specific to that site ID.
    If GreenLake Platform IAM issued token is used for authentication, then it is required to pass 
    'X-Role' header.
