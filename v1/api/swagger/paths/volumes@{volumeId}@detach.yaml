  summary: Detach existing volume from Host
  description: >
    Detaches the indicated volume from the host identified in the requestBody.  
    This detachment will delete the VolumeAttachment object that contains 
    details about the connection of the volume and will update the Host  to
    remove selected iSCSI configuration information.

    Note that the HostID is required in the body of the request to ensure that
    the operation is well understood and that a volume is not accidently being
    removed from the wrong host.
    
    If GreenLake Platform IAM issued token is used for authentication, then it is required to pass 
    'X-Role' and 'X-Workspaceid' headers.
