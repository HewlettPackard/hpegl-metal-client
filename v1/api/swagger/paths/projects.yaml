  description: >-
    Returns an array of all Project objects that have been created. This
    includes profile information for the project and project limits on resouces
    like hosts, private networks, volumes, and volume capacity. If GreenLake Cloud Services IAM issued token is
    used for authentication, then it is required to pass either 'Space' or
    'spaceid' header. When both are set, 'Space' header is ignored.
    If GreenLake Platform IAM issued token is used for authentication, then it is required to pass 
    'X-Role' and 'X-Workspaceid' headers.

  summary: Create a new project
  description: >-
    Adds a new Project which creates an isolated space for creating Hosts,
    Volumes, and private Networks. A project is often aligned to a specific team
    within an organization or a cluster. If GreenLake Cloud Services IAM issued token is used
    for authentication, then it is required to pass either 'Space' or 'spaceid'
    header. When both are set, 'Space' header is ignored.
    If GreenLake Platform IAM issued token is used for authentication, then it is required to pass 
    'X-Role' and 'X-Workspaceid' headers.
    Note that a Hoster, BMaaS Access Owner, BMaaS Tenant Owner or Service Platform Owner role 
    is required for this operation.
