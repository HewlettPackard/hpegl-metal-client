  serviceID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The image service identifier must be identifer of one of the available
      imaging services provided by the 'availableImage' array returned as part of
      the get /available-resources call. Images are typically described by
      category (e.g. Linux), flavor (e.g. ubuntu) and version (e.g.
      18.04-20190807)
  locationID:

    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The location ID must be one of those provided by the 'locationInfo' array
      returned as part of the get /available-resources call.  The locations are
      typically described by country, region, and data center.

      The location ID must also be one that has sufficient inventory for the
      selected instance type.  See the 'machineInventory' array as returned by the
      get /available-resources call to select a location that has machines
      available with the correct instance type.
  instanceTypeID:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
      The machine instance type ID must be one of those listed in the 'instanceTypes' array
      returned as part of the get /available-resources call.  This array
      provides the name and detailed description for each instance type.  Use the
      'machineInventory' array provided by the get /available-resources call to
      find a location with an adequate inventory of machines with the desired
      instance type.
  machineID:
    type: string
    format: uuid

  sshKeyIDs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      These IDs must correspond to the IDs for SSH keys already created within
      the context of the compute group.  These SSH keys and those included as
      'sshAuthorizedKeys' will be used together to provision SSH keys when the
      machine is imaged.

      format: uuid
  networkIDs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      The list of IDs corresponding to the networks that will be provisioned to
      the host. These networks must be among those listed in the 'networks' array
      returned by the get /available-resources call.  This list must include the
      ID for any network identified by the HostUseEnum as Required.
    items:
      type: string
      format: uuid
  preAllocatedIPs:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A list of pre-allocated IP addresses to be used for corresponding
      networks. This array of IP addresses, if present, is in one-to-one
      correspondence with Networks.

  networkForDefaultRoute:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
          The host's default network ID. This needs to be one of the values in the 
          "networkIDs" list.

  networkUntagged:
    type: string
    format: uuid
    description: >-
          ID of the network selected to be untagged. This needs to be one of the values in the 
          "networkIDs" list.
    example: 046b6c7f-0b8a-43b9-b35d-6489e6daee92
  volumeIDs:
    description: >-
      The list of IDs corresponding to existing, unattached volumes that should
      be attached to the new host.  The volume must be one of those listed in
      the 'volumes' array returned by the get /available-resources call.  In
      addition, the volume must be in the visible state and not a part of any
      current VolumeAttachment (see get volume-attachments)

  serviceNetsProviderMAC:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: >-
      The map of Service Network (Provider) ID to Provider MAC address.  
      The Service Network must be a provider network provisioned to this host.
