  title: HPE GreenLake Metal Client API
  version: 0.0.1
  description: >
    This Metal Client REST API provides access to bare metal as-a-service
    (BMaaS) within a single project context.  Clients are able to create
    fully-provisioned hosts, storage volumes, and project-specific private
    networks in an isolated project environment.  Project-owned resources that
    can be accessed via this API include... Host, Volume, VolumeAttachment,
    Network (project private), and SSH Key.  


    Each API call is done within a single project context.  The specific Project
    identifier must be provided within the header of each REST call. The server
    will validate that the provided authentication credentials (JWTs) are valid
    for the referenced project before any operation is performed.  If a single
    credential is valid for multiple projects, the client must still reference a
    single project in the header each API call.


    Clients can also access information about available services and resources
    through the AvailableResources object.  This object provides detailed 
    information about the OS imaging options, the machine size options, the
    storage volume options, data center locations, and such that are needed when
    creating hosts and volumes.

      Operations related to Projects.  A Project defines an isolated space for 
      creating Hosts, Volumes, and private Networks. A project is often aligned 
      to a specific team within an organization or a cluster
  - name: sshkeys
    description: >
      Operations related to SSH Keys.  Clients may define SSH Keys that can then
      be referenced by ID when creating a Host.  Particularly useful with a
      BMaaS client graphical user interface.

      Operations related to Hosts. A host is a fully-provisioned physical
      server. Clients may create, view, list, and delete hosts.

      Operations related to Volumes.  A Volume is an external storage volume
      that persists independent of the associated host.
